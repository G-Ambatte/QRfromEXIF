This is a quick and dirty Python script that uses Pillow and PyQRcode to extract the GPS location of a photo from the EXIF data, use that to create a Google Maps link, encode that in a QR code, then paste that over the bottom right corner of the original image.

My main intent is to use this with landscape photos, to allow viewers to identify the location that the photo shows.
